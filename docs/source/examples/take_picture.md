# Take Picture

This example demonstrates how to capture a single frame from Reachy Mini's camera and save it as an image file.

Run with:
```bash
python take_picture.py --backend [default|gstreamer|webrtc]
```

The captured image will be saved as `reachy_mini_picture.jpg` in the current directory.
